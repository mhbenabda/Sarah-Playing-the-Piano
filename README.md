# Sarah-Playing-the-Piano
Summary Hackahealth 2025 Zürich Team Sarah

## Challenge
Sarah loves music. She grew up playing the piano. Over time she
lost strength in her arms and now cannot enjoy the instrument she loves anymore.

While she still has mobility in her wrists and fingers, lifting and holding her arms above the keyboard has become too strenuous. To overcome this challenge, Sarah envisions a system that holds her arms and hands in position and guides her natural movements. The system should complement her abilities, reducing fatigue and giving her the freedom to play the piano again.

Even though the initial purpose of the device is for playing the piano, it can easialy be used for other application that require manipulation of objects on a table.
