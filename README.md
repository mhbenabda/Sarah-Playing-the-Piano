# Sarah-Playing-the-Piano
Summary Hackahealth 2025 Zürich Team Sarah

## Challenge
Sarah loves music. She grew up playing the piano. Over time she
lost strength in her arms and now cannot enjoy the instrument she loves anymore.

While she still has mobility in her wrists and fingers, lifting and holding her arms above the keyboard has become too strenuous. To overcome this challenge, Sarah envisions a system that holds her arms and hands in position and guides her natural movements. The system should complement her abilities, reducing fatigue and giving her the freedom to play the piano again.

Even though the initial purpose of the device is for playing the piano, it can easialy be used for other application that require manipulation of objects on a table.

## Requirements & User Needs
As it usually is in rehabilitation engineering, the needs are very user spefic and the final solution is very custom one person's needs, size, preferences... usually leading to a very complex system to satisfy the detailed specifications, or a very simple solution that is just so easy that it works. Luckly, what we came up with in this case is the later. 
That's we will describe in this section
